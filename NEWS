Although I intend to continue Windows support for Blitzed, I've removed
the pre-built exe and related files from this release.

I don't have easy access to Windows compilation software, so I
was unable to build a new Windows exe.

with me via the contact methods listed on the home page.

* Notable changes:
  * The .help command shows which channel commands can be used.
  * The .start command can be used by any user
  * Fixed crash if question line was greater than 256 characters
  * Game will no longer abort if it encounters a "bad" question.
    If it encounters 3 bad questions in a row, the game round will stop.
  * Various other minor bug fixes (See ChangeLog) or click the "closed"
    link on the Issues page.


* The database
  * One field removed from the database. Please see the instructions at
    http://ost.io/@andy5995/blitzed-irc-trivia/topics/217
    to use a database designed for versions v0.8.0 or below.


* The config file:
  * Two options were removed from the config file: CTCP Version and Realname.
    These are now hard-coded into the program.
  * Some minor changes made to some of the text

_It is strongly recommended to copy any unique settings from your existing
trivia.conf and use the new one._

1. Make a copy of your trivia.conf
2. Copy trivia.conf.sample to trivia.conf
3. Edit the file to suit your needs

I promise I will do my best as development of Blitzed moves forward. Strtok
and others (see AUTHORS file) did an excellent job designing this program,
and I have a great foundation of code to work with. From the users, I'd like
to request any feedback or suggestions you have regarding future development.

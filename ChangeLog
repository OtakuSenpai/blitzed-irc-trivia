    Removed ghosting and password feature, along with identifying to
    regain your nick and removing yourself from the game.

2016-09-13

    .help now shows in a private message window

    bugfix: if the questions.db file is not present, or encounters
    some other error while opening, the game is automatically stopped
    (in the future, Blitzed will exit instead. Please contribute patch if
    that type of thing interests you).

    I'm trying out a new forum at http://ost.io/@andy5995/blitzed-irc-trivia
    The old one is under strtok's SF account so I don't have any admin
    privileges there.

    Version 0.8.11 released

    Development version tagged at v0.8.12


2016-09-10

  Changed home page (now using the wiki at https://git.io/vi04F)

2016-09-08

  bugfix: Questions shorter than QUESTIONMAX should no longer cause
  a segfault (when longer than 256 chars).

  Game will no longer abort if it encounters a "bad" question. If it
  encounters 3 bad questions in a row, the game round will stop.

  Added .help channel command

2016-09-07

  Removed first field (nick) from questions database. The answers no
  longer begin with "from <nick>.

  Some channel commands are now prefaced by the "." (See README)

  The game can now be started by any user (.start command)

  Added ".version" channel command

  Added autoheader to configure.ac; a config.h will now be generated
  during configure, and included with h.h. The existing config.h has
  been renamed blitzed_config.h

  I forked this project - Blitzed IRC Trivia from:
  http://harlequin.sourceforge.net
  to: https://git.io/vicjS

  Made some minor edits so it would build - I've only tested it on
  Debian GNU/Linux 8 (Jessie)

  Fixed issues #3 and worked on #1
  (See https://git.io/vicjS/issues)
